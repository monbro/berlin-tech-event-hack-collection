berlin-tech-event-hack-collection
=================================

According to https://github.com/monbro/london-tech-event-hack-collection I am building a collection for Berlin here.

I try to find good places to grab information about various stuff and events. The order is randomly.

PLEASE CONTRIBUTE or pay me [a beer](https://www.gittip.com/monbro/)? :-)
